Valuable writing doesn't explain what the _author_ thinks and cares about. It changes what _readers_ think by identifying a problem _they_ care about and solving it.

There are no universal rules for how to write well. Your writing style should depend on who is reading and what they care about.

The subject of each sentence sets the focus of your writing. If those subjects focus on the wrong thing, rewrite them.
