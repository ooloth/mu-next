## Overview

- Used a Synology NAS to achieve this at first and stuck with it for a few months
- Ultimately decided to switch to a Mac mini with attached HDDs so I could interact with macOS instead of Synology's limited operating system

## Details

- M1 Mac mini
- Terraform 5-bay HDD enclosure
- Five 8 TB HDDs
  - Two media drives
  - Two backup drives (one per media drive)
  - One drive to store Time Machine backups from other devices
- Backup drives updated nightly by Carbon Copy Cloner
- Mac mini + two media drives backed up to Backblaze
- Plex Media Server consumes content of media drives and makes it available to Plex apps on home devices
