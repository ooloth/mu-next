## Writing

Valuable writing doesn't explain what the _author_ thinks. It changes what _readers_ think by identifying a problem they care about and solving it.

- ðŸ“º [The Craft of Writing Effectively](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM) â€¢ 82 minute video by Larry McEnerney explaining what was wrong with how we were taught to write in school and how to write content that's truly valuable to your specific community of readers. He gives the same lecture [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM) with lots of useful variations.
- ðŸ“º [My Creative Workflow with Notion](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uJgv0XQOehs) â€¢ 16 minute video by Ali Abdaal that includes the outlining prompts he uses to make sure his videos tell a story users will care about.
