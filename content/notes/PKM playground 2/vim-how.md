# How to start using Vim?

## Create a starter configuration

LazyVim for a starter configuration that’s easy to customize with help from the great docs and active community support in the project’s GitHub Discussions.

## Learn basic Vim movements

- TODO: add links that teach the language of vim

## Improve your keymaps

- Vim’s main feature is the ability to map any action to any keyboard shortcut you like
- Explore the LazyVim defaults and experiment with changing some of them so they make more sense to you
- TODO: share an example of something I changed and why

## Learn slowly

- Take your time
- It’s easy to get overwhelmed if you try to learn and update everything at once
- Solve your pain points one-at-a-time and beware changing multiple things at the same time — if something’s broken, it‘ll be harder to figure out what to fix.
