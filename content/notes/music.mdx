## Favourite Performances

- ðŸ“º [Sicilienne - Von Paradis | Podium Witteman](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fCIh4hqYJAM) â€¢ 4 minutes of Ivry Gitlis playing violin that shows how little perfection matters.
- ðŸ“º [Jacob Collier - Moon River - YouTube](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VPLCk-FTVvw) â€¢ 9 minute video by many Jacob Colliers that gets more complex and satisfying as it goes.
