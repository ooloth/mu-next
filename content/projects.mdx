<Project name='ecobee.com' url='https://www.ecobee.com'>

The ecommerce website I work on every day. I'm particularly proud of the role I played in building the new cart experience, which includes optimistic UI and reliable logic powered by [XState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/).

<Project name='Gatsby Tutorials' url='https://www.gatsbytutorials.com'>

A community-updated list of 200+ Gatsby.js tutorials I built for fun. The tutorials are searchable and filterable and include video, audio and written learning resources.

<Project name='Up and Running with Gatsby' url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAa1wh5ATm0&list=PLHBEcHVSROXQQhXpNhmiVKKcw72Cc0V-U'>

Ten beginner-friendly YouTube videos that teach the basics of React and how to get a Gatsby project up and running.

</Project>

<Project name='Dotfiles' url='https://github.com/ooloth/dotfiles'>

Config files with my favourite settings for Neovim, Tmux, Alacritty, Zsh, Git, Homebrew and macOS with a script that sets them up on a new Mac with one command.
