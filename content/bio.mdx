I'm a Senior Software Engineer on the API team at [ecobee](https://ecobee.com) where I help my team build the GraphQL API that powers the mobile and web apps ecobee's customers use to control their smart home products. This back-end role is a change of pace after 6+ years focused primarily on front-end development and I absolutely love having this opportunity to learn so much every day.

Before joining the API team, I was a Senior Software Engineer on ecobee's ".com" team where I helped migrate their ecommerce site from a legacy WordPress codebase to a modern stack including [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/) and led the development of site's shopping cart.

Before ecobee, I built and maintained 25+ marketing websites for [Coffeeshop Creative](https://www.coffeeshopcreative.ca/) and helped them modernize their tech stack and workflow to include static site generation with Gatsby; continuous deployment with Netlify; and performance, SEO and accessibility auditing with [Lighthouse](https://web.dev/measure/).

I enjoy teaching web development to new coders whenever I can and have a 10-video series on YouTube showing how to get started with React and Gatsby.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ooloth) where I talk about web development and share links to resources I found useful, or on [GitHub](https://github.com/ooloth) where I work on side projects in the open.
