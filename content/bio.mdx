I'm a Senior Software Engineer on the API team at [ecobee](https://ecobee.com) where I help build the GraphQL API that powers the mobile and web apps ecobee's customers use to control their smart home products. This back-end role is a change of pace after 7 years focused primarily on front-end development and I love how much I'm learning every day.

Before joining the API team, I was a Senior Software Engineer on ecobee's ".com" team where I helped migrate ecobee's ecommerce website from a legacy WordPress codebase to a modern stack built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/). Iâ€™m especially proud of leading the planning and development of ecobeeâ€™s shopping cart, which reliably facilitates $100K+ in sales per week.

Before joining ecobee, I built and maintained 25+ marketing websites for [Coffeeshop Creative](https://www.coffeeshopcreative.ca/) and initiated a number of new best practices, including a git-based workflow, continuous deployment with Netlify, and regular performance, SEO and accessibility audits with [Lighthouse](https://web.dev/measure/) and similar tools.

Outside of work, I enjoy teaching web development to new coders and created a [10-video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAa1wh5ATm0&list=PLHBEcHVSROXQQhXpNhmiVKKcw72Cc0V-U) that teaches beginners how to get started with React and Gatsby.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ooloth) where I chat about web development and share links to helpful learning resources, or on [GitHub](https://github.com/ooloth) where I work on most of my side projects in the open.
