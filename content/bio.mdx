At the moment, I'm working at ecobee and helping to migrate their ecommerce site from a legacy WordPress codebase to a modern stack that includes React, Gatsby, Netlify, Contentful and Shopify.

Before ecobee, I built and maintained 25+ marketing websites for Coffeeshop Creative and helped them modernize their workflow and tech stack to include static site generation with React and GatsbyJS, continuous deployment with Netlify, and performance, SEO and accessibility auditing with Lighthouse.

I also teach whenever I can, including on YouTube where I have ten beginner videos explaining how to get started with React and Gatsby. I'm currently working on a new course for newline teaching headless ecommerce with Next and Shopify.

You can find me on Twitter where I talk about web development and share links to useful resources, or on GitHub where I build in the open.
