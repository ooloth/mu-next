At the moment, I'm a Web Developer on the "dotcom" team at [ecobee](https://ecobee.com) where I'm helping migrate their ecommerce site from a legacy WordPress codebase to a modern stack that includes [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/).

Before ecobee, I built and maintained 25+ marketing websites for [Coffeeshop Creative](https://www.coffeeshopcreative.ca/) and helped them modernize their tech stack and workflow to include static site generation with Gatsby; continuous deployment with Netlify; and performance, SEO and accessibility auditing with [Lighthouse](https://web.dev/measure/).

I enjoy teaching web development to new coders whenever I can and have a 10-video series on YouTube showing how to get started with React and Gatsby. I'm currently working on a new course for [newline](https://www.newline.co/) that walks through how to build an ecommerce website with [Next](https://nextjs.org/) and Shopify.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ooloth) where I talk about web development and share links to resources I found useful, or on [GitHub](https://github.com/ooloth) where I work on a few side projects in the open.
