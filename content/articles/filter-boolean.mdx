Here's a trick I often find helpful.

## Bad array. Very, very bad.

You have an array of whatever:

```js
const array = [{ stuff }, { moreStuff }, ...]
```

But hiding in that array are some unusable `null` or `undefined` values:

```js
const array = [{ good }, null, { great }, undefined]
```

Those empty values might be a sneaky little gift from an API. Or you may have left them there yourself while validating the original data. Either way, you've got a problem.

## Looping over null data

If you try to perform actions on every item in the array, you'll run into errors when you hit those `null` and `undefined` items:

```js
const newArray = array.map(item => {
  // Of course this will work, wheeee...
  const assumption = item.thing
})

// Oh noooo...
üö® Cannot read property "thing" of undefined. üö®
üö® Cannot read property "thing" of null. üö®
```

Illegal! Now you're a criminal. Before you interact with an item, you need to make sure it exists.

## Null checks?

You could confirm each item exists by performing a `null` check before you use it:

```js
const newArray = array.map(item => {
  // Life has made me cautious.
  if (!item) {
    return item // Just forget it
  }

  // If we get this far, item exists.
  const assumption = item.thing
})
```

Buuut, now your code is getting cluttered. And worse, those dangerous empty values will be passed along to `newArray`. So when `newArray` is used, another round of suspicious `null` checks will be needed.

## The truth and only the truth

Want something better?

Here's my favourite way to quickly remove all empty items from an array:

```js
const array = [{ good }, null, { great }, undefined]

const truthyArray = array.filter(Boolean)
// truthyArray = [{ good }, { great }]
```

The `filter(Boolean)` step does the following:

1. Passes each item in the array to the `Boolean()` object
2. The `Boolean()` object [coerces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Type_coercion) each item to `true` or `false` depending on whether it's [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) or [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy)
3. If the item is truthy, we keep it

## Where did item go?

I love how concise `filter(Boolean)` is, but it might look strange that we aren't explicitly passing `item` to `Boolean`.

The main thing to know is that, in JavaScript, this:

```js
array.filter(item => Boolean(item))
```

is exactly the same as this:

```js
array.filter(Boolean)
```

The second version is just written in a ["tacit" or "point-free" style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming). We don't name each item and pass it into `Boolean`, but JavaScript understands that `Boolean` takes one argument, so it takes the argument `filter()` exposes and [passes it to Boolean for you](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/ch02.html).

If you find the first version easier to understand, use it! Readable code is more important than fancy tricks.

## Safer mapping

With our new tool, we can remove the `null` checks from above and chain a filtering step instead:

```js
const newArray = array.filter(Boolean).map(item => {
  // Item is always truthy!
  const assumption = item.thing
})
```

Now, our `map` can focus on what it's trying to do, and we've removed the empty values from our pipeline forever.

Hope that helps!
